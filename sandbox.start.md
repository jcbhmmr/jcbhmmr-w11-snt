In CSB the "Would you like to share anonymous..." prompt
stalls the start script. The "yarn start" terminal instance
also does not allow user input. Thus, to run this sandbox,
it is best to run it _manually_ in another terminal instance
with the "+" icon in the terminal area.

This still works when run manually (since you can exit the prompt):

```bash
$ yarn start
```
